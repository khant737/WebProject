              <h1>About me and this site</h1>
              <p>My name is liam frye and I finished grade 12 recently and also studying coding which help me <br>
                  to create this site.This site is also my first creation.It took me three days to build this <br>
                  site.For this site I have a lot of objective questions books.These books really helped me. <br>
                  It all begins with these books,first of all I need an idea for my project but I can not think <br>
                  anything and I found these books in my bag.I totally forget those books and I came out with <br>
                  these idea and I know how expensive these books are right now compare to last year.You do not
                  need to buy objective questions books,you do not need to go outside to buy these books and you do
                  not need to worry about price and objective question for exam.you can study everythings from here

               <h1>  Purpose of this site</h1>
               <p>This site is for those who can not afford to buy these books.These books are too expensive now a day.
                  And now  You do not need to look at the price and you can study whatever you want,you can look at the 
                  phone while studying.It is much easier to study with phone without getting bore and remember <br>
